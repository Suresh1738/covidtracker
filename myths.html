     <hr class=""></hr>
     <h5>TRUE or FALSE? A vaccine to cure COVID-19 is available.</h5>
     <p>The answer is false.

        There is no vaccine for the new coronavirus right now. Scientists have already begun working on one, but developing a vaccine that is safe and effective in human beings will take many months. </p>
     <h5>The new coronavirus was deliberately created or released by people.</h5>
     <p>The answer is false.

        Viruses can change over time. Occasionally, a disease outbreak happens when a virus that is common in an animal such as a pig, bat or bird undergoes changes and passes to humans. This is likely how the new coronavirus came to be.</p>
     <h5>Ordering or buying products shipped from overseas will make a person sick.</h5>
     <p>The answer is false.

        Researchers are studying the new coronavirus to learn more about how it infects people. As of this writing, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that the likelihood of becoming infected with COVID-19 from a commercial package is low since it has likely traveled over several days and been exposed to different temperatures and conditions during transit.</p>
     <h5> Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body</h5>
     <p> pplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause harm, especially if it enters the eyes or mouth. Although people can use these chemicals to disinfect surfaces, they should not use them on skin.

        These products cannot kill viruses within the body.</p>
     <h5>Only older adults and young people are at risk</h5>
     <p>SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.</p>
     <h5> Children cannot catch COVID-19</h5>
     <p>All age groups can become infected. Most cases, so far, have been in adults, but children are not immune. In fact, preliminary evidence shows that children are just as likely to become infected, but their symptoms tend to be less severe.</p>
     <h5> Garlic protects against coronaviruses</h5>
     <p>Some research suggests that garlic might slow the growth of some species of bacteria. However, COVID-19 is caused by a virus, and there is no evidence that garlic can protect people against COVID-19.</p>
     <h5> Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus</h5>
     <p>Thermal scanners can detect whether someone has a fever. However, other conditions, such as seasonal flu, can also produce fever.

        In addition, symptoms of COVID-19 can appear 2â€“10 days after infection, which means that someone infected with the virus could have a normal temperature for a few days before a fever begins.</p>
